# Welcome!

Hey there! I'm Hong, a backend developer who has mass-produced more bugs than features.

My superpower? Breaking things to learn how they work. My weakness? Also breaking things.

## My Journey (A Series of Fortunate Accidents)

### Gameloft - The "How Do We Make Money?" Era

Started at **Gameloft** in R&D, where my job was basically: *"Hey, can we do [cool thing] without spending money?"*

Some highlights:
- **Live Twitch integration in games** - Because watching others play is apparently more fun than playing yourself
- **Web-based games** - Before it was cool (it's still not cool, but we did it anyway)
- **Monetization research** - Finding creative ways to make gamers open their wallets. I'm not proud, but I am employed.

Learned C++ and Python here. Also learned that gamers will find bugs you never knew existed within 0.3 seconds of release.

### EcoIt - The "Make Government Go Brrr" Era

Moved to **EcoIt** to build document management systems for government organizations.

*"Can you digitize our paper-based workflow?"*
*"Sure, how many documents?"*
*"Yes."*

Built an OCR system that reads government documents - contracts, applications, official letters. The kind of paperwork that makes you question if bureaucracy is a feature or a bug.

Plot twist: Government handwriting is somehow worse than doctors'. At least doctors have an excuse.

### Everfit - The "Async Await My Gains" Era

Now at **Everfit**, building fitness tech with Node.js, NestJS, and MongoDB.

Current status: Still waiting for some callbacks from 2022. They'll resolve eventually. Probably.

## What I'll Write About

- Backend war stories (mostly the disasters)
- Neovim addiction diary
- Keyboard cult recruitment (Colemak + split keyboard)
- Things I broke and somehow fixed
- Tools that tolerate my chaos

## Fun Facts

- I type in Colemak on a split keyboard. Yes, I hate myself. No, I can't stop.
- I use Neovim. I entered willingly. I stayed because `:wq` is too mainstream.
- This site has vim keybindings. Press `?` if you dare.
- Dark mode only. My eyes have rejected the sun.

Stay tuned for more posts where I pretend to know what I'm doing!
