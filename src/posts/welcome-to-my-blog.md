# Welcome!

Hey there! I'm Hong, a backend developer with 6 years of experience building systems that (mostly) don't crash.

## My Journey

I started my career at **Gameloft** in the R&D team, where I learned to squeeze every millisecond out of game loops using C++ and Python. Nothing teaches you performance optimization quite like angry gamers complaining about frame drops.

Then I moved to **EcoIt**, where I built document management systems for government organizations. Yes, I digitized bureaucracy. The OCR system I built could even read doctor's handwriting (okay, maybe not that good).

Now I'm at **Everfit**, building fitness tech with Node.js, NestJS, and MongoDB. Still waiting for some callbacks from 2022.

## What I'll Write About

- Backend development tips and tricks
- My obsession with Neovim and LazyVim
- Keyboard adventures (Colemak + split keyboard)
- Performance optimization war stories
- Tools that make my life easier

## Fun Facts

- I type in Colemak on a split keyboard (Sofle v2)
- I can't exit Neovim. I don't want to.
- This site has vim keybindings. Try pressing `?`

Stay tuned for more posts!
