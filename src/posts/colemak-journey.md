# My Colemak Journey

I switched from QWERTY to Colemak while working full-time as a developer. Here's how it went.

## Why Switch?

- **Less finger travel** - 35% less movement than QWERTY
- **RSI prevention** - My wrists were starting to complain
- **The challenge** - I wanted to prove I could

## The Method

I went cold turkey. No QWERTY fallback.

*"This is fine"* - Me, typing at 10 WPM

## Week by Week

### Week 1 (10-15 WPM)
- Everything hurts
- Meetings become typing nightmares
- Started using voice-to-text for Slack

### Week 2 (20-30 WPM)
- Muscle memory starting to form
- Still frustrating but manageable
- `git commit` became muscle memory

### Week 3-4 (40-50 WPM)
- Feeling more natural
- Stopped thinking about key locations
- QWERTY muscle memory fading

### Month 2-3 (60-80 WPM)
- Back to near-original speed
- Fingers feel more relaxed
- No more wrist pain!

## The Combo: Colemak + Split Keyboard

I use a **Sofle v2** split keyboard with Colemak. Benefits:

- Shoulders not hunched
- Wrists straight
- Custom thumb clusters
- Layers for everything

```
Standard keyboard:  [============================]
                         ↑ hunched shoulders

Split keyboard:     [=====]           [=====]
                         ↑ natural position
```

## Tips If You Try This

1. **Don't switch on deadline week**
2. **Use keybr.com** for practice
3. **Print a layout cheat sheet**
4. **Accept the temporary slowdown**
5. **Tell your team** so they understand slow responses

## Was It Worth It?

100%. My typing is more comfortable, my wrists don't hurt, and I proved to myself I can rewire my brain.

Plus, nobody can use my keyboard now. Security feature!
